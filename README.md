# Features
The features of the app.

## Multi-portal search
There is a common issue that to find the best deal people always have to look through multiple sites. This project aims to fix that problem by allowing to search through many of those portals with a single click!

## Search watching
The searches done by user can be stored and monitored to later notify about new listing in all of the sties the search was done for.

# Tech stack
The technologies used for this project are as follows.

## Frontend
The idea for the frontend is a lightwieght, but capable TypeScript/Tailwind/React/Vite stack fully separated from the backend.

## Backend
The backend for this app will be a good old combo of ASP.NET/EF/PostgreSQL.

## Testing
Besides unit testing of mentioned parts of the app there will be Playwright tests added to fully cover the project.
